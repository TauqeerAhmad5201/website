      </Text>
      <Text mb={5}>
        We typically use “cookies” and similar techniques on our websites, which
        allow for an identification of your browser or device. A cookie is a
        small text file that is sent to your computer and automatically saved by
        the web browser on your computer or mobile device, when you visit our
        website. If you revisit our website, we may recognize you, even if we do
        not know your identity. Besides cookies that are only used during a
        session and deleted after your visit of the website (“session cookies”),
        we may use cookies in order to save user configurations and other
        information for a certain time period (e.g., two years) (“permanent
        cookies”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may configure your browser
        settings in a way that it rejects cookies, only saves them for one
        session or deletes them prematurely. Most browsers are preset to accept
        cookies. We use permanent cookies. If you block cookies, it is possible
        that certain functions are no longer available to you.

        In accordance with applicable law, we may include visible and invisible
        image files in our newsletters and other marketing e-mails. If such
        image files are retrieved from our servers, we can determine whether and
        when you have opened the e-mail, so that we can measure and better
        understand how you use our offers and customize them. You may disable
        this in your e-mail program, which will usually be a default setting. By
        using our websites and consenting to the receipt of newsletters and
        other marketing e-mails you agree to our use of such techniques. If you
        object, you must configure your browser or e-mail program accordingly.

        We may use Google Analytics or similar services on our website. These
        are services provided by third parties, which may be located in any
        country worldwide (in the case of Google Analytics Google Ireland Ltd.
        (located in Ireland), Google Ireland relies on Google LLC (located in
        the United States) as its sub- processor (both{' '}
        <strong style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>«Google»</strong>

        an anonymized basis). For this purpose, permanent cookies are used,
        which are set by the service provider. We have configured the service so
        that the IP addresses of visitors are truncated by Google in Europe
        before forwarding them to the United States and then cannot be traced
        back. We have turned off the «Data sharing» option and the «Signals»
        option. Although we can assume that the information we share with Google
        is not personal data for Google, it may be possible that Google may be
        able to draw conclusions about the identity of visitors based on the
        data collected, create personal profiles and link this data with the
        Google accounts of these individuals for its own purposes. If you have
        registered with the service provider, the service provider will also
        know your identity. In this case, the processing of your personal data
        by the service provider will be conducted in accordance with its data
        protection regulations. The service provider only provides us with data
        on the use of the respective website (but not any personal information

        Certain Recipients may be within Switzerland but they may be located in
        any country worldwide. In particular, you must anticipate your data to
        be transmitted to any country in which the Tezos Foundation Group is
        represented by its subsidiaries, affiliates, branches or other offices
        as well as to other countries in Europe and the USA where our service

        exception may apply for example in case of legal proceedings abroad, but
        also in cases of overriding public interest or if the performance of a
        contract requires disclosure, if you have consented or if data has been

        6. Retention Periods for your Personal Data
      </Text>
      <Text mb={5}>
        We process and retain your personal data as long as required for the
        performance of our contractual obligation and compliance with legal
        obligations or other purposes pursued with the processing, i.e. for the
        duration of the entire business relationship (from the initiation,
        during the performance of the contract until it is terminated) as well
        as beyond this duration in accordance with legal retention and
        documentation obligations. Personal data may be retained for the period
        during which claims can be asserted against our company or insofar as we
        are otherwise legally obliged to do so or if legitimate business
        interests require further retention (e.g., for evidence and
        documentation purposes). As soon as your personal data are no longer
        required for the above-mentioned purposes, they will be deleted or
        anonymized, to the extent possible. In general, shorter retention
        periods of no more than twelve months apply for operational data (e.g.,

        business relationship and the performance of our contractual obligations

      <Text mb={5}>
        We may partially process your personal data automatically with the aim
        of evaluating certain personal aspects (profiling). In particular,
        profiling allows us to inform and advise you about products possibly
        relevant for you more accurately. For this purpose, we may use
        evaluation tools that enable us to communicate with you and advertise
        you as required, including market and opinion research. In establishing
        and carrying out a business relationship, we generally do not use any
        fully automated individual decision-making (such as pursuant to article
        22 GDPR). Should we use such procedures in certain cases, we will inform
        you separately on this and advise you of your relevant rights if
        required by law.

        overriding interest (insofar as we may invoke such interests) or need
        the data for asserting claims. If exercising certain rights will incur
        costs on you, we will notify you thereof in advance. We have already
        informed you of the possibility to withdraw consent in Section 3 above.
        Please further note that the exercise of these rights may be in conflict
        with your contractual obligations and this may result in consequences
        such as premature contract termination or involve costs. If this is the
        case, we will inform you in advance unless it has already been
        contractually agreed upon.

        In general, exercising these rights requires that you are able to prove
        your identity (e.g., by a copy of identification documents where your
